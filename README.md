## paper-sheet-detection

# Project introduction
 This program can scan the paper sheet and transfer it into a **flat rectangle** image by using the information
from **curved side edges**.
# How to use it
  * Put your picture in the same folder with Normal_Warp.py.
  * Replace the name of your picture of paper sheet with 'p8.jpg' in line 7 of Normal_Warp.py
  * Run Normal_Warp
# Requirement
  * python3
  * cv2
  * numba
  * matplotlib
  * numpy

  # Backgroud
  The real edge of a document maybe curved rather than straight, so the code will restore a flatter original appearance of the document according to the curved
edge information of the document.

# Effect
  As an example, you can see how my project deal with p8.jpg.
  <div>
<center>
  
<img src="EdgeAndRectangle.png"  alt="Edged" title="Original pic. with marked border" width=150\>
<img src="After.png"  alt="After" title="By Quadrilateral way" width=150\>
  <img src="RuledSurface.png" alt="Ruled" title="By Ruled Surface Model(My project)" width=150\>
</center>
</div>
You can see the four-point perspective transformation preserves the curved characteristics of the paper, while the ruled surface restoration of this project flattens the document in the original image to a certain extent.

Therefore, if you has a photo of document, with stright upper and down edges, you can use my program to restore your original flat document.






Its edge is curved. Usually the software(IOS, Android) would use circumscribed quadrilateral to approximate the border, and then use warp perspection to transfer the image to a rectangle. This kind of effect is following:

<center>

<figure>
<img src="EdgeAndRectangle.png" />
<img src="After.png" />
</figure>



<\center>
